## **Elevator Pitch**
 **"Zero-Frame Buffer (ZFB) is a lightweight, fast, and fully C-based game engine library designed for low-latency rendering using memory-mapped video buffers. It features a temporal framebuffer system that updates only changed pixels, optimizing performance and memory usage. Unlike traditional game engines, ZFB is built as a standalone C library, making it easy to integrate into any project while maintaining full control over rendering. Additionally, ZFB is designed as an educational tool, helping students and beginner developers understand framebuffer graphics and game physics without unnecessary complexity."**

## **What Makes ZFB Special?**

| Feature                  | ZFB Library  | Other Engines  |
|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Memory-Mapped Rendering**  | Direct pixel access | Uses GPU or abstraction layers |
| **Temporal Framebuffer**    | Only updates changed pixels | Redraws full screen per frame |
| **Written in Pure C**       | No dependencies, lightweight | Often requires SDL, OpenGL, etc. |
| **Minimalist & Clean**      | Simple structure, easy to modify | Often bloated with features |
| **Optimized for Retro / Low-Power Devices** | Works on older hardware | Assumes high GPU usage |
| **Extending-Friendly**      | Fully documented, modular | Hidden complexity |
| **Beginner-Friendly Library** | Provides simple functions for direct integration | Complex APIs requiring deep understanding |

##  **User Stories**

### **User Story 1: Rendering Pixels**
**As a game developer, I want to render pixels directly to the screen** so that I can create low-level graphics effects.

 **Acceptance Criteria**  
- [ ] A function exists to set individual pixels at specific `(x, y)` coordinates.  
- [ ] The framebuffer can be cleared and updated at a defined refresh rate.  
- [ ] The pixel format (RGB, ARGB, etc.) is documented and consistent.  
- [ ] The rendered pixels appear on the screen without extra processing.  
- [ ] The system supports basic drawing operations (lines, rectangles, etc.).  

---

### **User Story 2: Optimized Updates**
**As a performance-focused developer, I want to update only changed pixels** so that I can optimize rendering.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- [ ] A secondary buffer tracks which pixels have changed since the last frame.  
- [ ] Only modified pixels are written to the framebuffer, reducing redundant updates.  
- [ ] Performance benchmarking shows that partial updates improve frame times.  
- [ ] A function exists to force full-screen updates when needed.  
- [ ] Debug mode can visualize which pixels were updated in the last frame.

### **User Story 3: No External Dependencies**
**As an indie developer, I want an engine without external dependencies** so that I can build projects without worrying about third-party libraries.

 **Acceptance Criteria**  
- [ ] The engine is written in pure C with no third-party libraries required.  
- [ ] The only system API dependencies are OS-level framebuffer access (e.g., `/dev/fb0` on Linux).  
- [ ] The compilation process is simple and works with standard C compilers (e.g., GCC, Clang).  
- [ ] No linking against SDL, OpenGL, or external rendering libraries.  
- [ ] The build system is documented to ensure users can compile and run without extra setup.  

---

### **User Story 4: Real-Time Framebuffer Manipulation**
**As a graphics programmer, I want to modify the framebuffer in real-time** so that I can experiment with shaders and visual effects.

 **Acceptance Criteria**  
- [ ] A function exists to access and modify pixel data dynamically.  
- [ ] The framebuffer updates in real-time, with low latency (~16ms per frame for 60 FPS).  
- [ ] A function allows for real-time effects like color shifts, blurring, or distortions.  
- [ ] Users can manipulate framebuffers without affecting engine stability.  
- [ ] Debug mode allows visualizing buffer changes per frame.  

---

### **User Story 5: Simple & Well-Documented Code**
**As a beginner in C, I want the library to be simple and well-documented** so that I can learn and understand it easily.

 **Acceptance Criteria**  
- [ ] Every function is clearly commented with explanations.  
- [ ] The project includes a README with setup instructions.  
- [ ] The code follows consistent naming conventions and formatting.  
- [ ] A basic example program demonstrates rendering a simple scene.  
- [ ] The engine provides error messages and logs for debugging.  
- [ ] The documentation explains how the framebuffer works and how to modify it.  

---

### **User Story 6: Beginner-Friendly Library**
**As a student or beginner in game development, I want a simple library** so that I can experiment with graphics without deep technical knowledge.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- [ ] The library provides simple functions like `draw_pixel()` and `clear_screen()`.  
- [ ] The library abstracts away complex memory management and rendering logic.  
- [ ] A set of tutorials and example projects demonstrate library usage.  
- [ ] The library remains lightweight and efficient, ensuring fast execution.  
- [ ] Error handling provides clear messages for common beginner mistakes.  

---

### **User Story 7: Educational Tool**
**As an educator, I want to use the library as a learning tool** so that students can understand framebuffer-based graphics programming.

 **Acceptance Criteria**  

- [ ] Documentation explains framebuffer concepts in an easy-to-understand manner.  
- [ ] Step-by-step example projects guide students through fundamental game development principles.  
- [ ] The library is structured to encourage gradual learning, starting from basic graphics to more advanced physics and rendering concepts.  
- [ ] The Library provides clear feedback and error messages to help students debug their programs.
