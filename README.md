# ZFB
ZFB (Zero Framebuffer) is a physics/game engine whith a big focus on portability and being lightweight. ZFB is supposed to run on as many platforms as possible while being completely lightweight which is achieved by the following:
- No dependencies
  - as of now we make use of `libpng` to read png images, which will change in future updates to come
- Only the operating systems APIs and/or the standart libraries
- Easy to use while maintaining a lot of freedom
